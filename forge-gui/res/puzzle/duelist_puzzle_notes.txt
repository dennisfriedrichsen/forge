Duelist #3
-------------------
"Sitting on Defense" - survive opponents turn with cards provided (not implemented), I think goal = "survive"
"thirtysomething" - Win this turn.
    - solution doesn't work with current rules
    - modifications: Red Mana Battery 8 counters -> 10 counters, Rasputin - 7 counters -> 6 counters, Triskelion - add +0/+1 counter (could have been from Dwarven Weaponsmith back in the day)
    - Tested in this configuration and confirmed working.
